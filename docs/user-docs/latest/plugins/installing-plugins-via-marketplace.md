# Marketplace plugins

<!--::: callout ðŸš§ The Marketplace is currently not available for v4. It will be back soon, stay tuned!
In the meantime, plugins can be installed via the Command Line Interface (see [Developer Documentation](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.md#strapi-install)).
::: -->

The Marketplace contains optional plugins built to customize and extend the default Strapi installation. Plugins are listed the in-app Marketplace, which is located in the admin panel, noted by the ![Marketplace icon](../assets/icons/marketplace.svg) _Marketplace_.Plugins are also discoverable through the [web Marketplace](https://market.strapi.io/). Marketplace plugins are installed using the CLI (see [Developer Documentation](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.md#strapi-install)).

## The in-app Marketplace interface

The Marketplace displays the available plugins on individual cards containing:

- the plugin name
- the plugin description
- a _learn more_ link for additional information, including detailed implimentation instructions.
- a button to copy the install command
- a badge indicating if the plugin is ![made by Strapi]((../assets/icons/icon_official.svg)) or validated by Strapi

The Marketplace plugins are searchable, and can be filtered by types, plugins, made by Strapi, and Strapi validated.  
<!-- add icons for badges in-line with the bullet point above -->
